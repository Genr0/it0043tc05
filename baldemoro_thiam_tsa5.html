            <p class="text">Guts is a former mercenary and branded wanderer who travels the world in a constant internal struggle between pursuing his own ends and upholding his attachments to those dear to him. At one time driven solely by his will to survive, Guts finds purpose in life upon joining the Band of the Falcon, greatly helping in the faction's storied successes during the Hundred-Year War as captain of the band's raiders. He eventually becomes dissatisfied with clinging to Griffith's dream and departs from the band in pursuit of his own. Following the horrors of the Eclipse prompted by Griffith, Guts embarks on a two-year war against the God Hand and apostles, becoming increasingly embittered on his one-track quest for retribution. He in time realizes protecting his regressed lover is more important to him, as well as something he cannot do alone, and thus puts aside his quest for revenge while fostering camaraderie with new companions.</p>

            <p class="text">Griffith is the leader of the reborn Band of the Falcon and Supreme Commander of the Midland Regular Army. Famed for his leadership in numerous battles, he is celebrated as a savior across the continent and revered as the "Falcon of Light". As the leader of the original Band of the Falcon, he and his mercenaries end the Hundred-Year War, bringing peace to the war-torn kingdom of Midland. Following the departure of his trusted confidant Guts, Griffith impulsively seduces Princess Charlotte, leading to his imprisonment, year-long torture and the apparent collapse of his dream.</p>

            <p class="text">Casca is a former unit commander of the Band of the Falcon and an estranged companion of Guts. Originally a callow peasant girl living in a remote mountain village, she develops into a capable warrior upon joining the Band of the Falcon and aids greatly in the group's storied successes during the Hundred-Year War. Following Guts' departure and Griffith's subsequent imprisonment, she is forced to assume the position of the band's leader, succeeding in preventing the complete annihilation of the Band of the Falcon and rescuing Griffith from the Tower of Rebirth.</p>

            <p class="text">Schierke is a young 'witch-in-training' and was once a disciple of the witch Flora. She is a member of Guts' Traveling Party. Schierke is mature for her age, quiet, and withdrawn. As a disciple, she was very respectful toward her mistress and was deeply saddened upon her demise. Presently, she gets along well with most of Guts' party, as well as with total strangers such as Sonia and Isma. As a result of being rather sheltered throughout her childhood, she is disdainful toward the human world and the Holy See's religion but finds life outside of the forest bearable while traveling with her companions.</p>

            <p class="text">The Skull Knight is an enigmatic figure, having waged war against demonkind for a millennium. Approximately 1000 years old, he has vast knowledge of events surrounding the world, as well as remarkable foresight regarding the flow of causality. It is the Skull Knight who breaks into the fifth Eclipse and saves Guts and Casca from their demise. He later resurfaces during the Kushan invasion of Midland atop the twice reincarnated Ganishka slashing right above Femto, and with his Sword of Behelits creates an astral fissure used by the angel to trigger the Great Wave of the Astral World.</p>
